# Zokuten (static clone)

This is a lightweight static build that recreates the layout/theme from the screenshots you shared.

## Run locally
Option A (double‑click):
- Open `index.html` in your browser.

Option B (recommended local server):
- Python: `python -m http.server 8000`
- Then open: http://localhost:8000

## Notes
- The contact form is demo-only (shows an alert).
- No Webflow export is included; this is a pure HTML/CSS/JS version you can host anywhere.
